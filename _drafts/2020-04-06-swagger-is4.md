## ðŸ’¡ When you are creating one of APIs in microservices architecture best way to create clear documentation with a frieldy GUI to directly test them is Swagger. Running Swagger with API is quite easy and well documented, but when API is protecting by OAuth it's tricki to integrate it. In this post I will show you how to runn sample .NET Core 3.1 API with Swagger (Swashbuckle for .NET) and Swagger Authroziation via Identity Server 4.
###

### 1. Add Swagger to ASP NET Core project 
First we need to install nuget package via Package Manager Console
```bat 
Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
``` 
After that go to **Startup.cs** file and change ***ConfigureServices*** method to look like this bellow:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
    {
        c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo { Title = "My API", Version = "v1" });
    });
}
```
and change ***Configure*** method like this:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{ 
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
    {
        c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");
    });
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
    app.UseRouting();
}
```
##### And basicly that is it to configure Swagger with minumum options. 
#
To see the results of Swagger work we need to add Controller and Model: 
```csharp
[Route("v1/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class DemoController : ControllerBase
{ 
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetDemoValues() 
        => Ok(new string[] { "value1", "value2" });
 
    [HttpPost]
    [Route("post")]
    public IActionResult PostDemoModel(DemoModel model) 
        => Ok(model);
    }
``` 
```csharp
public class DemoModel
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
Before we start application we can go to **launchSettings.json** file and change ***launchUrl*** to ***swagger***
```
"launchUrl": "swagger",
```
##### Now we can run our demo API and see the results
