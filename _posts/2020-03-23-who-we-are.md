Welcome to Talentech’s official technology blog.
In 2019 four leading HR-tech companies, HR Manager, ReachMee, Webcruiter and Talmundo, merged to become Talentech. Tech element in our name is not by a mistake, it's a core of our company. Under the hood of great business processes are dozens of services and different technologies. Here you can find out a little about us. How do we play with technologies and fixing some of daily problems. 

On this blog we plan to share posts about technology we are working with, various challenges and how we have solved them and other topics we find useful to write about. 
 
Don't be scared to ask or comment.
 
code, deploy, repeat
enjoy
